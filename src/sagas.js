// Notes:

/* 
takeLatest -  is a helper function provided by redux-saga that will trigger a new workerSaga when it sees an API_CALL_REQUEST, while cancelling any previously triggered workerSaga still in process.

yield - in a generator basically represents an asynchronous step in a more synchronous/sequential process â€” somewhat like await in an async function.

watcherSaga - is a saga that watches for an action to be dispatched to the Store, triggering a workerSaga.

workerSaga - attempts to fetchDog, using another redux-saga helper function call, and stores the result (a resolved or failed Promise) in a response variable.
